# Changelog

## 1.0.3 - 2026-06-16

- Added configurable widget show/hide animation effects and speed presets in Settings, with Chinese and English labels.
- Reworked tray animation execution to use smoother frame pacing, real window movement for slide effects, and composition-driven opacity/scale transitions.
- Reduced widget animation flicker by avoiding duplicate item transitions during mapped-folder reveal and by restoring the final visual state consistently.
- Improved tray left-click behavior so visible desktop-layer widgets hidden behind other apps are raised temporarily instead of being hidden immediately.
- Improved tray-launched Settings behavior so the Settings window opens temporarily on top and clears topmost state after focus leaves.
- Improved temporary foreground behavior for newly created widgets, widget dragging, and folder picker ownership.
- Added performance logging support and coverage for the performance logger.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-06-16

- Added Chinese and English localization across widgets, settings, tray menus, onboarding, dialogs, notes, empty states, and status messages.
- Added a language selector in Settings and refreshed localized text dynamically when the user changes languages.
- Reworked onboarding to expose important setup choices directly in the flow, including managed-drop behavior, the default storage path, folder mapping, and startup launch.
- Improved onboarding visuals, right-side step animations, and repeated scene playback so each step better matches the feature being introduced.
- Fixed startup-launch behavior so DeskBox starts silently to the tray after reboot instead of opening Settings.
- Improved tray behavior so right-click "Show all widgets" temporarily raises widgets just like left-clicking the tray icon.
- Improved widget show/hide animation with a unified right-to-left motion, removed per-widget cascade timing, and reduced mapped-widget flicker.
- Improved mapped-folder reveal behavior by suppressing duplicate item transitions during window animation.
- Improved light-mode styling in onboarding and settings, including text contrast, surface colors, and the active-step indicator shape.
- Improved widget selection behavior so selecting an item in one widget clears selections in other widgets.
- Improved drag-selection responsiveness and reduced repeated visual work during rectangle selection.
- Improved shortcut handling so broken `.lnk` files use the native Windows resolve/delete prompt when opened.
- Improved file operations around cut/copy, mapped folders, desktop drag-out refresh, and shell clipboard data.
- Updated README to Chinese by default, added an English README switch, and refreshed release documentation.
