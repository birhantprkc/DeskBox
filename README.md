DeskBox is a lightweight WinUI 3 desktop organizer for Windows 11. It creates native-feeling desktop widgets for collecting files, mapping folders, and bringing those groups forward from the tray or a global hotkey. It does not replace the Windows desktop shell; it adds one focused layer for keeping files easier to reach and easier to clean up.

## Download

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Tianyu199509/DeskBox/releases).

Current release: 1.0.6

- [DeskBox_Setup_1.0.6_x64.exe](https://github.com/Tianyu199509/DeskBox/releases/download/v1.0.6/DeskBox_Setup_1.0.6_x64.exe)

The installer checks for .NET 8 Runtime x64 and Windows App Runtime 2.1.3 x64. If either dependency is missing, the setup flow can download and install it for you.

## What's New In 1.0.6

- Added Quick Capture, an optional feature widget for saving text, links, screenshots, and recent clipboard content locally.
- Added a clearer Quick Capture workflow with Records, Pinned, and Recent views, hover actions, scoped search, drag-out support, and save-to-file-widget actions.
- Improved upload workflows with managed storage access, Quick Access pinning, mapped-folder shortcuts, and an "open storage folder" tray entry.
- Improved drag/drop and clipboard behavior so files stay files, text stays text, and DeskBox's own clipboard writes do not pollute Recent items.
- Improved window layering, widget refresh, onboarding scaling, custom icons, filename extension display, migration feedback, and compact Quick Capture dialogs.

See the full [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). GitHub Release copy is available in [docs/releases/v1.0.6.md](docs/releases/v1.0.6.md).

## Why DeskBox Exists

Many desktop organization tools take over the desktop: they replace familiar interactions, rebuild file entry points, or become a second desktop shell. DeskBox takes a narrower approach. The Windows desktop stays the Windows desktop, and your files stay normal files. DeskBox only adds a clean layer for moving, copying, grouping, and viewing those files.

The product is intentionally built around native Windows behavior. Widgets use WinUI 3, Windows App SDK, DWM corners, acrylic-style surfaces, and a tray-first workflow so the app feels like it belongs on Windows 11 instead of sitting on top of it.

## Features

- **Managed desktop widgets**: create file collection widgets backed by a real folder.
- **Folder mapping**: display an existing folder as a desktop widget without moving its contents.
- **Quick Capture**: keep reusable text, links, screenshots, and recent clipboard content in an optional local-only feature widget.
- **Move or copy on drop**: choose whether managed widgets organize by moving files or by keeping originals and adding copies.
- **Tray controls**: create widgets, map folders, show or hide all widgets, temporarily raise widgets, open managed storage, open Settings, toggle startup launch, and exit.
- **Global hotkey**: enable a keyboard shortcut for quickly showing, hiding, or raising widgets.
- **Native file operations**: drag in, drag out, paste, cut, rename, delete, open, reveal in Explorer, and use keyboard shortcuts.
- **Appearance controls**: tune theme, opacity, DWM corner style, icon size, text size, spacing, filename width, and list details.
- **Storage maintenance**: change the default managed storage root, pin it to Quick Access, clean orphan folders, and confirm actions that may affect user files.
- **First-run onboarding**: learn the core concepts and configure important defaults before using the app, then replay onboarding from Settings when needed.

## Requirements

- Windows 11.
- .NET 8 Runtime x64.
- Windows App Runtime 2.1.3 x64.

DeskBox is currently tested on Windows 11. Windows 10 may work in some environments, but it is not a validated target.

For development, install the .NET 8 SDK. Visual Studio 2022 with Windows App SDK workload is recommended.

## Install And Uninstall

The installer is built with Inno Setup. It preserves existing app settings, widget configuration, and managed storage content during overwrite installs.

Startup launch is handled silently through the tray. If DeskBox is already running and Windows starts it again at login, the second startup instance exits without opening Settings.

During uninstall, DeskBox stops the running app first. Managed storage content is not deleted silently; when cleanup may affect user files, the installer asks before removing anything.

## Build

Restore and build:

```powershell
dotnet restore .\DeskBox.sln -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64
dotnet build .\src\DeskBox\DeskBox.csproj --configuration Debug --no-restore -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 -v:minimal
```

Run tests:

```powershell
dotnet test .\DeskBox.sln --configuration Debug --no-restore -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 -v:minimal
```

Create a Release x64 publish output and installer:

```powershell
dotnet publish .\src\DeskBox\DeskBox.csproj --configuration Release -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 -p:SelfContained=false -p:WindowsAppSDKSelfContained=false -o .\artifacts\publish\DeskBox\x64 -v:minimal
& 'C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 7\ISCC.exe' .\installer\DeskBox.iss
```

Installer output:

```text
Output\DeskBox_Setup_1.0.6_x64.exe
```

## Data Locations

- Settings are stored under `%LocalAppData%\DeskBox\data`.
- The default managed storage root is `%UserProfile%\DeskBox`.
- Generated folders such as `bin`, `obj`, `Output`, `artifacts`, and `TestResults` are ignored by Git.

## Feedback

DeskBox is still an early public release. If you hit file drag/drop issues, runtime dependency problems, window layering bugs, uninstall edge cases, or Windows-version compatibility problems, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Tianyu199509/DeskBox/issues) with reproduction details.
